# CityIOServer
Python TCP server for the CityIO project.

This repo aims to serve as a collector for all input+sever+output files needed for new projects which utilize the cityIO platform. Server side files would rarely need to be updated, but input or output modules (for unity, grasshopper, processing etc.) might be updated per project. 
For that reason, components from this repo should be copied and manipulated in each individual project and not in branches/master here.
